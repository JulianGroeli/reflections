What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Github creates a .git directory to store metadata information about tracked files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a preparation area for making a commit. It allows selection of specific files to be added to the commit, and allows planning of a commit before it is processed.
