When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Keeping your work on a remote repository make sense for most situations. It would make sense to work locally if you are working on a small project by yourself and you want to keep it private and don't want to pay Github for a private account.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Just like with other actions in git, making syncronization manual forces it to be a more deliberate decision by users. There's less likelyhood of overwriting files unintentionally, and it probably makes the functionality more predictable and more likely to meet the expectations of users.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones of other repositories that Github makes on its servers.
Clones are copies or repositories regardless of location.
Branches are a series of commits within a repository.

Forks ideal for cloning a repository and maintaining a link back to the original repository to give credit to the original creator and to make it easy to suggest changes in future versions.
Clones are often used in conjunction with github to download content from an online repository to a local computer.
Branches are used to develop new features or sets of commits within a repository.
